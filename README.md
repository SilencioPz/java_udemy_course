<h1 align="center">Java Udemy Course</h1>

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 12px;">
Did until class 59 on Java course with teacher John, now bringing to the public this knowledge. I did some refactor, because John's version was too different.

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 12px;">
Credits: teacher John, from <a href="https://caveofprogramming.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;">https://caveofprogramming.com/</a> -> The best GUI course on Udemy, the others have few content and much less hours compared to him.

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 12px;">
I also recommend <a href="https://api.blackbox.ai/" style="text-decoration: underline;">https://api.blackbox.ai/</a> -> Very useful AI for programming, lots of doubts appear when you're coding and this tool is very helpful. Not only doubts, but is a way to see if the code can be improved in any way and, most important, detect and correct errors that may appear.

Using Linux, use this command: <code>java -jar /path/to/your/file/Swing2.jar</code> -> You can also in the Downloads folder, press right on the mouse and select Open In Terminal and just type: <code>java -jar Swing2.jar</code> -> More direct and easy.<br>
On Windows, as far as I remember, you can download a JRE from Oracle and with the right app open the jar file and see the GUI.
